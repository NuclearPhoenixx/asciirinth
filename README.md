In ASCIIrinth your are finding your way through a labyrinth of ASCII character to get from point A to point B. Why would you do that? Well, why not!

You can load and play any compatible map or create your own maps with the included map maker (it's really easy). Control-wise you can choose between WASD and the arrow keys, you can also set a custom key for the pause-menu. The cool thing about this game is that you can play it on your graphical install, on an SSH server, on headless mode, etc.

Oh and it's also absolutely tiny in size and Open Source!

Still working on this, but 1.0.0 should be pretty stable.
